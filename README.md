## 📖 Overview

DeepResearch Bench addresses the absence of a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating Deep Research Agents (DRAs). Our benchmark consists of **100 PhD-level research tasks**, each meticulously crafted by domain experts across **22 distinct fields**, including:

* 🔬 **Science & Technology**: Physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, and engineering
* 💼 **Finance & Business**: investments, personal finance, marketing, and human resources
* 💻 **Software**: Topics related to the use of software and the internet
* 🌍 **Others**: Art & Design, Entertainment, History, Industrial, Transportation, Travel, and more


## Benchmark Construction

### Topic Distribution Analysis

To ensure DeepResearch Bench reflects real-world research demands, we analyzed **96,147 anonymized user queries** from web search-enabled LLM interactions.These queries were classified into **22 topic domains** based on the WebOrganizer taxonomy, revealing the authentic distribution of human deep research needs across different fields.

### Expert Task Collection

Guided by real-world demand distribution, we invited **PhD-level experts and senior practitioners** (5+ years experience) to design challenging research tasks within their domains. Each submission underwent rigorous manual screening for:

- **Quality**: High research standards and complexity
- **Clarity**: Clear task definitions and requirements  
- **Authenticity**: Grounded in real research scenarios
- **Challenge Level**: Testing upper limits of DRA capabilities

This process yielded **100 high-quality benchmark tasks** (50 Chinese, 50 English) that maintain the same topical balance as observed in real-world usage.


## Evaluation Framework

![Framework Overview](pics/framework.png)

DeepResearch Bench introduces two complementary evaluation methodologies designed to comprehensively assess Deep Research Agents:

### 🎯 RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation)

RACE evaluates **report generation quality** through a sophisticated multi-step process:

- **Dynamic Criteria Generation**: Automatically generates task-specific evaluation criteria across four key dimensions:
  - 📚 **Comprehensiveness**: Coverage breadth and depth of the research topic
  - 🔍 **Insight/Depth**: Quality of analysis and insight generation  
  - 📋 **Instruction-Following**: Adherence to specific task requirements
  - 📖 **Readability**: Clarity, organization, and presentation quality

- **Reference-Based Scoring**: Compares target reports against high-quality reference reports to ensure discriminative evaluation
- **Weighted Assessment**: Uses dynamic weights adapted to each task's specific requirements

### 🔗 FACT (Framework for Factual Abundance and Citation Trustworthiness)

FACT evaluates **information retrieval and grounding capabilities** through:

- **Statement-URL Extraction**: Automatically extracts factual claims and their cited sources from generated reports
- **Deduplication**: Removes redundant statement-URL pairs to focus on unique factual claims
- **Support Verification**: Uses web scraping and LLM judgment to verify whether cited sources actually support the claims
- **Citation Metrics**: Calculates:
  - **Citation Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly supported citations
  - **Effective Citations**: Average number of verifiably supported citations per task

### Submit to Leaderboard

If you would like to obtain an **official leaderboard entry** on DeepResearch Bench, please prepare the following materials and send them by email to:

- `dumingxuan@mail.ustc.edu.cn`
- `imlrz@mail.ustc.edu.cn`

**Required submission materials:**

1. **A temporary key with access to Gemini-2.5-Pro**
   - This key is used only for verification/evaluation.
   - It should remain valid during the evaluation window.
   - Supported examples include:
     - Google AI Studio
     - Vertex AI
     - OpenRouter
     - Other official providers with Gemini-2.5-Pro access

2. **The raw generated articles**
   - Please provide your model outputs in the same format as the benchmark raw data.
   - Reference example:
     - [`data/test_data/raw_data/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest.jsonl`](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench/blob/main/data/test_data/raw_data/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest.jsonl)

3. **Reproducibility link**
   - If your model/agent is **open-source**, please provide a repository link that allows others to reproduce the results.
   - If your model/agent is **closed-source**, please provide the product page and/or API link used for reproduction and verification.

4. **Model metadata**
   - **Model name**
   - **Model/project link**
   - **Open-source license** (for open-source submissions; if closed-source, please clearly indicate that it is proprietary)

**Recommended additional files:**

- `results/race/<model_name>/race_result.txt`
- `results/fact/<model_name>/fact_result.txt`

Providing these files can help us speed up verification, but the raw generated reports and the temporary evaluation key are the most important requirements.

## 🛠️ Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Gemini API key (for LLM evaluation)
- Jina API key (for web scraping in FACT evaluation)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep_research_bench.git
cd deep_research_bench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Configuration

Set the required API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# Set Gemini API key for LLM evaluation
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

# Set Jina API key for web scraping
export JINA_API_KEY="your_jina_api_key_here"
```

├── run_benchmark.sh        # ← Add your model names here, then run
└── requirements.txt        # Dependencies
```

**Quick Start Flow:**
1. Use queries from `data/prompt_data/query.jsonl` → Run your Deep Research Agent
2. Save outputs to `data/test_data/raw_data/<model_name>.jsonl`
3. Add model name to `TARGET_MODELS` in `run_benchmark.sh`
4. Run: `bash run_benchmark.sh`

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Model Data

Run your Deep Research Agent on the benchmark queries and save outputs in the required format:

**Input**: Use queries from `data/prompt_data/query.jsonl` (100 benchmark tasks)

**Output**: Save results to `data/test_data/raw_data/<model_name>.jsonl`

**Required format** (each line should contain):
```json
{
    "id": "task_id", 
    "prompt": "original_query_text", 
    "article": "generated_research_article_with_citations"
}
```

### 2. Configure Models to Evaluate

Edit `run_benchmark.sh` and add your model name:
```bash
TARGET_MODELS=("your-model-name")
```

### 3. Run Evaluation

```bash
bash run_benchmark.sh
```

Results will be saved to:
- RACE evaluation: `results/race/<model_name>/race_result.txt`
- FACT evaluation: `results/fact/<model_name>/fact_result.txt`

### Custom LLM Integration

If you're not using the official Gemini API or want to use other LLMs for evaluation, modify the `AIClient` class in `utils/api.py` to implement your custom LLM interface.

## Acknowledgements
